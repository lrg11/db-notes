Elf
The theoretical guarantee why Elf could achieve a notable compression ratio is due to its Eraser step, which transforms a floating-point value to another one with more trailing zeros under a guaranteed bound. This step can potentially improve the compression ratio of most XOR-based compression methods tremendously. The number of erased bits is dependent merely on the decimal significand count ùõΩ, and a bigger ùõΩ usually means fewer bits erased. If ùõΩ ‚â§ 14, we can erase at least ‚åà51‚àí14√óùëôùëúùëî210‚åâ= 5 bits, which always guarantees a positive gain. But if ùõΩ ‚â• 16, we can only erase at most ‚åä53‚àí(16‚àí1)√óùëôùëúùëî210‚åã=3 bits, leading to a negative gain as it requires at least 4 bits to record ùõΩ‚àó.

Elf is a lossless compression algorithm because it aims to recover the original floating-point values without any precision loss. The erasing step in Elf introduces some precision loss, but it is compensated by the restoring step, which recovers the original values from the erased ones. Furthermore, Elf uses a novel XOR-based compressor to encode the XORed results containing many trailing zeros, which further improves the compression performance without losing any information. Therefore, Elf achieves a notable compression ratio with a theoretical guarantee while maintaining the lossless property.

The efficiency gain that can be benefited from Elf over the best competitor Chimp128 depends on the dataset being compressed and the value of ùõΩ. According to the experimental results presented in the paper, if ùõΩ is not large, Elf compression algorithm is even 8.7% ‚àº33.3% better than the Eraser-enhanced Gorilla and Chimp. In particular, when ùõΩ=6, the compression ratio gain of Elf over Chimp128 achieves the highest (33% and 55% relative improvement in a time series dataset and a non-time series dataset, respectively). However, for datasets with large ùõΩ, ElfEraser cannot enhance the XOR-based compressors, including Chimp128, because for large ùõΩ, ElfEraser gives up erasing to avoid a negative gain. Therefore, the efficiency gain of Elf over Chimp128 depends on the specific dataset and the value of ùõΩ.

Elf considers only the neighboring values because it uses an erasing-based lossless floating-point compression algorithm. The algorithm transforms a floating-point value to another one with more trailing zeros under a guaranteed bound. The number of erased bits is dependent merely on the decimal significand count, and a bigger decimal significand count usually means fewer bits erased. Therefore, Elf can only erase a small number of bits for large decimal significand counts, which leads to a negative gain as it requires more bits to record the modified decimal significand count. To ensure a positive gain, Elf only performs erasing when the modified decimal significand count is less than 16 and the number of significant mantissa bits is greater than 4. By considering only the neighboring values, Elf can achieve good compression performance in most real-world scenarios.

ElfXORcmp is effective for several reasons. Firstly, it utilizes a novel approach to compress the first value of a time series, which tends to have a large number of trailing zeros after being erased some insignificant mantissa bits. By recording the number of trailing zeros and storing the non-trailing bits with fewer bits, ElfXORcmp can compress the first value using fewer bits than existing XOR-based compressors.

Secondly, ElfXORcmp borrows some ideas from existing XOR-based compressors such as Gorilla and Chimp, but extends them to achieve a better compression ratio. Specifically, ElfXORcmp stores the XOR difference between the current value and the previous value, similar to most existing XOR-based compressors. However, it also considers only the neighboring values, unlike Chimp 128, which considers 128 earlier values to find the best matched value. This approach can reduce the complexity of maintaining a hash table with a large size.

Overall, ElfXORcmp is effective because it combines a novel approach to compress the first value with an optimized version of existing XOR-based compressors, which can achieve a much better compression ratio than existing XOR-based compressors.

TSXor
The paper presents TSXor, a simple yet effective lossless compressor for time series data. TSXor leverages the redundancy/similarity between close-in-time values through a window that acts as a cache to improve the compression ratio and decompression speed. The algorithm achieves up to 3x better compression and up to 2x faster decompression than state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world datasets. The experiments show that TSXor outperforms FPC and Gorilla on seven public time series datasets, achieving a higher compression ratio and faster decompression speed. TSXor uses a single byte in 85% of the cases to reference an identical 8-byte value that occurred in the sliding window.

TSXor achieves a better compression ratio than Gorilla due to its ability to exploit redundancy and similarity between close-in-time values through a window that acts as a cache. TSXor heavily leverages on the window of cached values, and in 85% of the cases, it uses a single byte to reference an identical 8-byte value that occurred in the sliding window. This is not possible with Gorilla, which uses range-based encoding to compress double-precision floating-point values. The range-based encoding by Gorilla incurs a higher cost in bits for values with larger ranges, which limits its compression effectiveness.

Regarding the compression speed of TSXor, the text mentions that it trades compression speed for better compression and faster decoding speed. For each value to encode, the whole window is scanned, which slows down the compression speed. In comparison to Gorilla, which is the fastest algorithm in terms of compression speed due to its simplicity, TSXor is slower. However, TSXor achieves better compression ratios and faster decompression speed than Gorilla and FPC, the other compression algorithm used for comparison in the study. The text also mentions that future work will explore ways to improve the encoding time of TSXor, such as exploiting vectorized instructions.
 TSXor achieves fast decompression speed, which is important for reducing training time without compromising accuracy. Additionally, TSXor trades compression speed for better compression and faster decoding speed
Chimp
The paper proposes a novel streaming compression algorithm, called Chimp, for floating point time series data. The algorithm utilizes properties exhibited by a diverse set of time series to provide significant space savings while maintaining compression and decompression speed. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art streaming approaches in terms of both compression and access time, and offers a significantly improved trade-off between space and speed. The paper also provides definitions for time series and floating point time series, and discusses the IEEE 754 double precision floating point format and the state-of-the-art Gorilla compression scheme for floating-point time series. The source code, data, and/or other artifacts have been made available at https://github.com/panagiotisl/chimp.

The section "PROPERTIES OF REAL-WORLD TIME SERIES" discusses the properties of floating point values in various real-world time series datasets. The study investigates whether these properties align with the design principles of the Gorilla compression algorithm. The study finds that the distribution of the number of trailing zeros resulting from XOR between two consecutive values is not likely to have a large number of trailing zeros. Instead, most resulting XORed values exhibit a considerable number of leading zeros. Based on these findings, the Chimp compression algorithm is proposed, which provides significant space savings that are competitive with slower, yet extremely effective general-purpose compression schemes. The algorithm builds upon the distribution of the number of leading zeros to provide a very space-efficient representation that is frequently reused by successive values. Moreover, the algorithm induces impressive compression rates by exploiting trailing zeros only when their number is large enough to provide savings.
- The paper suggests several directions for future work. One possible direction is to investigate the performance of the Chimp algorithm on different types of time series data, such as those with different distributions or those that exhibit different patterns of change over time. Another direction is to explore the use of Chimp in conjunction with other compression techniques, such as dictionary-based compression or delta encoding, to further improve the compression ratio. Additionally, the paper suggests exploring the use of Chimp in distributed systems, where the compression and decompression of time series data can be performed in a distributed and parallel manner. Finally, the paper suggests investigating the use of Chimp in conjunction with machine learning techniques, such as anomaly detection or forecasting, to further improve the performance of time series analysis tasks.

Therefore, it can be inferred that Chimp and Chimp 128 outperform LZ4 in terms of compression time and space efficiency for time series data.
- How does chimp compare to snappy
- According to the information provided, Chimp is faster than Snappy in terms of compression time and offers better compression ratios. Snappy is mentioned as the most efficient general purpose compression algorithm, but it is not as effective as Chimp in compressing time series data. Chimp is also compared to other general purpose compression algorithms such as Xz, Brotli, LZ4, and Zstd, and it is shown to provide better compression ratios while being faster than most of them in terms of compression time.
- what is the Principle of snappy algorithm
- The principle of the Snappy algorithm is to use a combination of Huffman coding and a form of LZ77 compression to achieve fast compression and decompression speeds. It works by dividing the input data into small blocks and compressing each block independently. The algorithm uses a sliding window to find repeated sequences of bytes and replaces them with references to previous occurrences of the same sequence. The references are encoded using Huffman coding, which assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring sequences. The resulting compressed data is stored in a block format that includes the Huffman codebook and the compressed data. During decompression, the codebook is used to decode the compressed data and reconstruct the original input data. Snappy is designed to be fast and efficient for general-purpose compression, but it may not achieve the same compression ratios as other algorithms that prioritize compression ratio over speed.
- what is the Principle of lz4 algorithm
- The principle of the LZ4 algorithm is similar to that of the LZ algorithm, which is to replace repeated occurrences of substrings in the input data with references to their previous occurrences. However, the LZ4 algorithm uses a different approach to achieve higher compression and decompression speeds. Instead of maintaining a sliding window of previously processed data, the LZ4 algorithm divides the input data into blocks and compresses each block independently. Within each block, the algorithm uses a combination of literal encoding and dictionary encoding to represent the data. The literal encoding simply represents each byte of the input data as is, while the dictionary encoding replaces repeated substrings with references to their previous occurrences within the same block. The dictionary used by the LZ4 algorithm is constructed dynamically based on the input data, and is optimized for fast access and update. The resulting compressed data is typically smaller than the original input data, and can be decompressed quickly using a reverse process. The LZ4 algorithm is widely used in various applications that require fast compression and decompression, such as network protocols, file systems, and databases.
- what is the Principle of xz algorithm
- The principle of the xz algorithm is to use a combination of the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm) compression algorithm and the XZ container format to achieve high compression ratios on various types of data. The LZMA algorithm is a variant of the LZ77 algorithm that uses a combination of dictionary-based and statistical compression techniques to achieve high compression ratios. The XZ container format, on the other hand, is a flexible and extensible format that allows for the storage of compressed data streams along with metadata and other information. The xz algorithm works by first dividing the input data into blocks and compressing each block using the LZMA algorithm. The resulting compressed data is then stored in an XZ container along with metadata such as the size of the original data, the size of each compressed block, and the compression settings used. The xz algorithm is widely used in various applications that require high compression ratios and efficient compression and decompression speeds, such as software distribution, archiving, and backup.
- what is the Principle of brotli algorithm
- The principle of the Brotli algorithm is to use a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and context modeling to achieve high compression ratios for a wide range of input data types. It uses a sliding window to find repeated patterns in the input data and replaces them with references to previous occurrences, while also using Huffman coding to encode the resulting sequence of literals and references. Additionally, it employs a context modeling technique to adapt the encoding to the specific characteristics of the input data. Overall, the Brotli algorithm aims to provide a good balance between compression ratio and speed, making it suitable for a variety of applications.
ELF
Elf can transform a floating-point value to another one with more trailing zeros under a guaranteed bound because of its Eraser component. The Eraser component erases the last few bits of a floating-point value, which increases the number of trailing zeros in the XORed results. The number of bits erased is determined by the decimal significand count of the value, which is calculated using the ùê∑ùëÜ(ùë£) function. Theorem 4 in the paper provides a bound on the number of bits that can be erased based on the decimal significand count. This erasing strategy guarantees a positive gain in compression ratio for values with a decimal significand count of 14 or less. The Restorer component of Elf can recover the original floating-point value from the erased value without any precision loss.

Elf and Zstd are both compression algorithms, but they have different approaches and target different types of data. Zstd is a general-purpose compression algorithm that can be applied to various types of data, including floating-point values. It uses a dictionary-matching stage and a fast entropy-coding stage to achieve a good trade-off between compression ratio and efficiency. On the other hand, Elf is specifically designed for compressing floating-point values and leverages the characteristics of floating-point data to achieve a higher compression ratio. Elf uses an erasing and restoring strategy to increase the number of trailing zeros in the XORed results, which can significantly reduce the number of bits

According to the information provided in the paper, Elf can achieve a better compression ratio than Chimp 128, which is an upgraded version of Chimp that uses 128 earlier values to find the best matched value. Elf achieves this by performing an extra erasing step before compressing the data, which can potentially improve the compression ratio of most XOR-based compression methods tremendously. On the other hand, Chimp 128 leverages the least 14 significant mantissa bits as its hash key, which makes it hard for ElfEraser to enhance its compression ratio. Therefore, Elf considers only the neighboring values, unlike Chimp 128. Overall, Elf can achieve a compression ratio improvement of 8.7% to 33.3% over the Eraser-enhanced Gorilla and Chimp, which verifies the effectiveness of the optimization for XOR compression.

Firstly, it utilizes a novel approach to compress the first value of a time series, which tends to have a large number of trailing zeros after being erased some insignificant mantissa bits.
